Description: File non-deterministic information stripper — stand-alone tool
DescDetail: <<
StripNondeterminism is a library for stripping non-deterministic information
such as timestamps and filesystem ordering from various file and archive
formats.
.
This can be used as a post-processing step to improve the reproducibility of a
build product, when the build process itself cannot be made deterministic.
.
It is used as part of the Reproducible Builds project, although it should be
considered a temporary workaround which should not be needed in the long
term; upstream software should be reproducible even without using such a tool.
.
This package installs the stand-alone ‘strip-nondeterminism’ tool.
