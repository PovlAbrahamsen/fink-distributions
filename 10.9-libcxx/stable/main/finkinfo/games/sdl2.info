Description: Cross-platform multimedia library
DescDetail: <<
Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed to
provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics
hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is used by video playback software,
emulators, and popular games including Valve's award winning catalog and many
Humble Bundle games.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
SDL 2.0 is a major redesign compared to SDL 1.2, and is incompatible both
on the source and the binary level. Thus software that is using SDL 1.2
needs to be explicitly rewritten to be able to use SDL 2.0. However,
it is possible to install SDL 1.2 (provided by the Fink package `sdl`)
and SDL 2.0 (provided by the Fink package `sdl2`) in parallel.

We fiddle with libiconv detection because the autoconf tests for it
are simply broken (they do not account for the fact that GNU
libiconv renames the symbol via #defines in iconv.h, and thus
fail to detect it.
We thus simply hardcode the test results.
