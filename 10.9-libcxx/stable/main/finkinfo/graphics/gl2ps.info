Description: Library for OpenGL vector output
DescDetail: <<
GL2PS is a C library providing high quality vector output for any OpenGL
application. The main difference between GL2PS and other similar libraries
is the use of sorting algorithms capable of handling intersecting
and stretched polygons, as well as non manifold objects. GL2PS provides
advanced smooth shading and text rendering, culling of invisible primitives,
mixed vector/bitmap output, and much more...
GL2PS can currently create PostScript (PS), Encapsulated PostScript (EPS),
Portable Document Format (PDF) and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files, as
well as LATEX files for the text fragments. GL2PS also provides limited,
experimental support for Portable LaTeX Graphics (PGF). Adding new vector
output formats should be relatively easy; you can also use the excellent
pstoedit program to transform the PostScript files generated by GL2PS into many
other vector formats such as xfig, cgm, wmf, etc.
<<
DescUsage: <<
This package contains documentation and demos.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_LATEX=TRUE is used to not force a rebuild of
the PDF documentation (which is identical to the tarball version).

CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_GLUT=TRUE can be used to block detection of
glut and stop building examples.
