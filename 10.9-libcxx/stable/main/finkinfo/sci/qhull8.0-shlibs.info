Package: qhull8.0-shlibs
Version: 2020.2
Revision: 1
Description: Calculate convex hulls and related structures
License: BSD
Maintainer: Alexander Hansen <alexkhansen@users.sourceforge.net>
DescDetail: <<
Qhull computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, halfspace 
intersections about a point, Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site 
Delaunay triangulations, and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. 
It runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and higher dimensions. It implements 
the Quickhull algorithm for computing the convex hull. Qhull 
handles roundoff errors from floating point arithmetic. It 
computes volumes, surface areas, and approximations to the 
convex hull.
<<
DescUsage: <<
This package contains the shared libraries.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
* The prior static-only qhull package was maintained by Stefan Langerman 
  <fink@slef.org>.
* Upstream has decided to build the executables statically, so Depends:
  %N is not required.
* Patch library install_name to be a full and not relative path.
