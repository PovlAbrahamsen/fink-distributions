Description: Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication
DescDetail: <<
	HMAC is used for message integrity checks between two parties that
	share a secret key, and works in combination with some other Digest
	algorithm, usually MD5 or SHA-1.  The HMAC mechanism is described in
	RFC 2104.
	
	The Digest::HMAC module follow the common Digest:: interface, but the
	constructor takes the secret key and the name of some other simple
	Digest:: module as argument.
