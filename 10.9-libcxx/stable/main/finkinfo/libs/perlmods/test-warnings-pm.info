Package: test-warnings-pm
Version: 0.038
Revision: 1
Type: perl
License: Artistic/GPL
Description: Test for warnings and the lack of them
DescDetail: <<
	This module is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement for
	Test::NoWarnings: it also adds an extra test, but runs this test
	before done_testing calculates the test count, rather than after. It
	does this by hooking into done_testing as well as via an END block.
	You can declare a plan, or not, and things will still Just Work.

	# cpan-meta-check-pmXXX allows informational diagnostics about

	# handle it at the fink level anyway and would entail build-
