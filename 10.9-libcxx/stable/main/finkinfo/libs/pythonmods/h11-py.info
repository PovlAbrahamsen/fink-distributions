DescDetail: <<
This is a little HTTP/1.1 library written from scratch in Python,
heavily inspired by hyper-h2.

It's a "bring-your-own-I/O" library; h11 contains no IO code whatsoever.
This means you can hook h11 up to your favorite network API, and that
could be anything you want: synchronous, threaded, asynchronous, or your
own implementation of RFC 6214 - h11 won't judge you. (Compare this to
the current state of the art, where every time a new network API comes
along then someone gets to start over reimplementing the entire HTTP
protocol from scratch.) Cory Benfield made an excellent blog post
describing the benefits of this approach, or if you like video then
here's his PyCon 2016 talk on the same theme.
