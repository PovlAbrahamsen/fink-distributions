DescDetail: <<
This is a little HTTP/1.1 library written from scratch in Python,
heavily inspired by hyper-h2.

This repository contains a pure-Python implementation of a HTTP/2
protocol stack. It's written from the ground up to be embeddable in
whatever program you choose to use, ensuring that you can speak HTTP/2
regardless of your programming paradigm.
