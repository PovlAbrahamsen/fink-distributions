DescDetail: <<
You're writing a library. You've decided to be ambitious, and support
multiple async I/O packages, like Trio, and asyncio, and ... You've
written a bunch of clever code to handle all the differences. But... how
do you know which piece of clever code to run?

This is a tiny package whose only purpose is to let you detect which
async library your code is running under.
