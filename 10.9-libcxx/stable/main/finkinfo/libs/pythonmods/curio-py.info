DescDetail: <<
Curio is a coroutine-based library for concurrent Python systems
programming using async/await. It provides standard programming
abstractions such as tasks, sockets, files, locks, and queues as well as
some advanced features such as support for structured concurrency. It
works on Unix and Windows and has zero dependencies. You'll find it to
be familiar, small, fast, and fun.
