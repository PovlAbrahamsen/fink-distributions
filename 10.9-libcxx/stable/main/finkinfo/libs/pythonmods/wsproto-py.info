DescDetail: <<
This repository contains a pure-Python implementation of a WebSocket
protocol stack. It's written from the ground up to be embeddable in
whatever program you choose to use, ensuring that you can communicate
via WebSockets, as defined in RFC6455, regardless of your programming
paradigm.

This repository does not provide a parsing layer, a network layer, or
any rules about concurrency. Instead, it's a purely in-memory solution,
defined in terms of data actions and WebSocket frames. RFC6455 and
Compression Extensions for WebSocket via RFC7692 are fully supported.
