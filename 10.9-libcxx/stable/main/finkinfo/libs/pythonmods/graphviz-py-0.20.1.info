DescDetail: <<
This package facilitates the creation and rendering of graph
descriptions in the DOT language of the Graphviz graph drawing software
from Python.

Create a graph object, assemble the graph by adding nodes and edges, and
retrieve its DOT source code string. Save the source code to a file and
render it with the Graphviz installation of your system.

Use the view option/method to directly inspect the resulting (PDF, PNG,
SVG, etc.) file with its default application. Graphs can also be
rendered and displayed within Jupyter notebooks (formerly known as
IPython notebooks, example) as well as the Jupyter Qt Console.

DescPort: <<
* Upstream patch to remove use of mock and instead use builtin
unittest.mock.
