Description: Python web developement middleware
DescDetail: <<
Python Paste brings consistency to Python web development and web
application installation, providing tools for both developers and
system administrators.

Using Paste does not exclude the use of other WSGI libraries and
components. There's really no advantage to putting new development or
major rewrites in Paste, as opposed to putting them in new
packages. Because of this it is planned that major new development
will happen outside of Paste. This makes Paste a very stable and
conservative piece of infrastructure for building on.
