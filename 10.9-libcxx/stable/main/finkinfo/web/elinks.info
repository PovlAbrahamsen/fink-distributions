DescDetail: <<
Development version of Links (Lynx-like text WWW browser), with more
liberal features policy and development style.

This is the ELinks tree - intended to provide a feature-rich version
of Links. Its purpose is to provide an alternative to Links, and to
test and tune various new features, but still provide good rock-solid
releases inside stable branches.

This is the "felinks" fork of the original "elinks" package.
<<
DescPort: <<
This pkg builds and uses its own highly- and fairly-undocumentedly-
hacked gettext libs, so make sure to see *that* gettext's headers
before any fink or system ones that may exist.

Fix general CPPFLAGS handling. See:
http://linuxfromscratch.org/pipermail/elinks-users/2006-November/001354.html

-rdynamic test is fragile (upstream had previously documented it as
such). It incorrectly passes for us, so just skip it.
<<
DescPackaging: <<
Not gonna bother fixing the .h checking issues that lead to "present
but cannot be compiled" noise for netinet/ip.h and net/if.h
^-- maybe only occurs on older OS X?

Make sure the internal gettext doesn't install charset files.

Rebuilding the docs uses docbook-utils, which has elinks as a
potential dependency. Circularity! We already have docs in the
tarball, so force configure to avoid looking for those utility
packages.

Fink has gssapi, guile, lua53, spidermonkey, and some other optional
dependencies, but leaving them disabled for now due to inertia.

Fink doesn't have libtre.

Upstream recommends using openssl rather than gnutls.

Upstream seems dead, OpenBSD dropped it in Marh 2017 because of
security issues and non-responsiveness from developers. It was forked
as "felinks", which is what Debian uses for its elinks package, and so
do we.
