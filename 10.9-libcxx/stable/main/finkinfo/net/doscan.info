Description: Fast network scanner
DescDetail: <<
	doscan is a tool to discover TCP services on your network. It is designed for 
	scanning a single port on a large network. doscan contacts many hosts in 
	parallel, using standard TCP sockets provided by the operating system. It is
	possible to send strings to remote hosts, and collect the banners they return.

	There are better tools for scanning many ports on a small set of hosts, for 
	example nmap.

	Note: upstream has suspended development, with the last release in 2014.

DescPort: <<
